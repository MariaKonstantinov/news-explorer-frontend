**:four_leaf_clover: General Project Concept**

This project represents a service where users can search for news articles and save them to their profiles.

The website has 2 main features:

Front-End Implementation:

1. When the user enters a keyword in the search bar, the website sends a request to the News API service, finds all the relevant articles over the last week, and displays a list of cards for each of them.

2. The website displays all articles saved by a user in a special section of the website.

Back-End Implementation - two APIs:

1. The News API, which returns JSON data containing headlines, bylines and other data from keyword searches.

2. An API for user authentication and saving articles. Created this back-end server independently.
